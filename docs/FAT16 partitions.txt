FAT16 partitions
================

DOS 1
-----
The original DOS 1 doesn't support FAT16 partitions.
In IDEDOS1 a FAT16 option is provided, partly based on SOLiD's BEER DOS1 v1.9.
The call to DSKIO is made compliant with the DOS 2 FAT16 patch and Nextor to
provide sector bits 16..23 as a parameter in register C.

Known limitations
-----------------
Free disk space calculation on large FAT16 partitions is very slow, mostly
noticable when doing a directory listing with the DIR command.
The number of root directory entries should not exceed 255, on standard
formatted FAT16 partitions this is typically set to 512. The directoy entries
higher than 255 or not visible.
Subdirectories are not supported.


DOS 2
-----
The original DOS 2 versions don't support FAT16 partitions.
In the development sources a FAT16 option is provided, which is partly
based on OKEI's FAT16 patch v0.12.

Differences with the FAT16 patch
--------------------------------
1. Integrated and optimized FAT16 code.
2. FORMAT and RAMDISK functions are still available.
3. Fast free disk space calculation, without using extra RAM segment.
   Optional cut off for slow disk interfaces.
4. Identification of FAT12 / FAT16 partitions compliant with MS standard.
5. Enabled booting from FAT16 partition.
6. On FAT16 partitions the Extended BPB serial number is used for disk
   change detection.
7. Drive table init (DPB+1E patch) is applied in the kernel module to make
   the RAMDISK accessible if it is initialized after boot.

Known limitations
-----------------
The internal FORMAT function can only format standard DOS2 floppy disks.
Some external commands don't work on FAT16 partitions e.g. CHKDSK.
