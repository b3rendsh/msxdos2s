FAT16 partitions
================

DOS 2
-----
The original DOS 2 versions don't support FAT16 partitions.
In the development sources a FAT16 option is provided, which is partly
based on OKEI's FAT16 patch v0.12.

Differences with the FAT16 patch
--------------------------------
1. Integrated and optimized FAT16 code.
2. FORMAT and RAMDISK functions are still available.
3. Fast free disk space calculation, without using extra RAM segment.
   Optional cutoff at 2048 clusters for slow disk interfaces.
4. Identification of FAT12 / FAT16 partitions compliant with MS standard.
5. Enabled booting from FAT16 partition.
6. Drive table init (DPB+1E patch) is applied in the kernel module to make
   the RAMDISK accessible if it is initialized after boot.
7. Undelete (dirty bit) is only active on DOS2 FAT12 partitions, not on
   DOS1 FAT12 or FAT16 partitions to avoid very slow directory entry creation
   on very large disks and/or slow disk interfaces.

Known limitations
-----------------
The internal FORMAT function can only format standard DOS2 floppy disks.
Some external commands don't work on FAT16 partitions e.g. CHKDSK or UNDEL.


DOS 1
-----
The original DOS 1 doesn't support FAT16 partitions.
In IDEDOS1 a FAT16 option is provided, partly based on SOLiD's BEER DOS1 v1.9.
+ The call to DSKIO is made compliant with the DOS 2 FAT16 patch and Nextor to
provide sector bits 16..23 as a parameter in register C.
+ Free disk space calculation is cutoff at 2048 clusters for fast dir command.
+ A 16-bit directory entry value is also used internally so on a typical FAT16 
partition with max 512 directory entries all files in the root can be accessed.

Known limitations
-----------------
Some low level disk (BASIC) commands may not work on FAT16 partitions e.g. 
absolute sector read/write commands.
Subdirectories are not supported.
