Development steps in creating the BEER 2.0 disk rom
===================================================

A. Create a DOS 1.03 baseline
-----------------------------
1. Start with a copy of the latest DOS 1.03 source from sourceforge.
2. Convert source code syntax so it assembles with z88dk's z80asm.
3. Create a stub driver file for SONY and PHILIPS fdd disk versions.
4. Check that the assembled source is 100% identical to the OEM versions 
   (up to the point where the OEM fdd driver code starts)
5. Analyse and define the entry points for the disk kernel and driver.

B. Create a DOS 1.03 + BEER 2.0 disk rom 
----------------------------------------
1. Start with the baseline DOS 1.03 source created under A.
2. Analyse differences with BEER 1.8 source and 1.9 binary in ghidra and
   with Total Commander file compare content function.
3. Split the BEER 1.x modifications in 3 modules/files:
	a. DOS 1 baseline disk system with beer ide patches
	b. beer ide enhancements to the disk system (Multi-FAT swapper)
	c. beer ide low-level driver
4. Make the low-level driver compliant with DOS 1 and 2 specifications.
5. Remove cosmetic changes and unused old beer ide code in the 3 modules.
6. Change the disk boot process to prevent this disk interface to always 
   take control after BASIC is loaded, so it will now work with other 
   interfaces in the machine.
7. Resolve compatibility issues due to changed boot process.
8. Fix a few bugs in the driver.

The code differences between 1.9 and 2.0 driver are marked with the FLOPPY
and BEER19_OLD directives or "beer19:" comments in the source code.
