Development source labels 
=========================

Original
--------
The MSXDOS sources originated from the msxsyssrc repository:
- Source re-created with Z80DIS 2.2.
- Source comments by Arjen Zeilemaker.

Address labels
--------------
Cxxxx   Called subroutine
Jxxxx   Jumped to address
Ixxxx   Information (data) address
Rxxxx   Relocated address
Dxxxx   Data address

Code may be at a different address now then the xxxx value suggests.
Any $ and . characters in labels are replaced by the S and _ characters.

Modifications by H.J. Berends
-----------------------------
- Changes so the source can be compiled with z88dk's z80asm.
- Restructured text, modified comments and additional comments.
- Moved code to use free space in the rom.
- Modified code is marked by a compiler directive or "Mod:" comment.

Address labels
--------------
1. Upper case labels without prefix, refers to MSX standard names.
2. Upper case labels with prefix:
   F_X     BDOS function X
   K_X     Kernel procedure X
   KB_X    Kernel procedure X with call to main bios
   PH_X    Paging helper routine X
   Other   Local constants (e.g. IDE_READ)
3. camelCase labels:
  Subroutines with non MSX standard names, may start with object prefix.
  Address labels with a local range inside a subroutine start with _ or r.
4. Some subroutine names are based on Nextor source code.
