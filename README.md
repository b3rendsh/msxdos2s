# msxdos2s
MSX DOS 2 sources:  
- Copy of MSX DOS 2.2 sources from sourcefourge (subset)  
- Converted sources to assemble with z88dk's z80asm  
- Modified sources to create a MSX DOS 2.2 32K ROM  

## Information
This repository contains modified MSX DOS 2.2 sources. 
The purpose is to create a 32K ROM that can run from a standard MSX cartridge.  
Kanji support and dos2memchk selfcheck features are removed to reduce size.  
  
The original 64K ROM was provided on a cartridge with a ROM mapper.  
  
The source files are provided and modified for study purposes.
